<div class="infoText">
A pluot ( /ˈpluːɒt/)[1] is a tradename for varieties of interspecific plum or plumcot developed in the late 20th century by Floyd Zaiger.[2][3] "Pluot" is a registered trademark of Zaiger's Genetics. Like the aprium, it is a complex cross hybrid of plum and apricot. The pluot exhibits more plum-like traits than the aprium,[4] and is also called an interspecific or IS plum.
The fruit's exterior has smooth skin closely resembling that of a plum. Pluots are noted for their sweetness, their intense flavor[citation needed], and very juicy pulp. Pluots are also rich in vitamin A.
