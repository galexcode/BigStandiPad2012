BigStand 2012
=======

BigStand is an Offline Music Browser for performers of all kinds. Load your lyrics, chords, cheatsheets and sheet music into your iPad when you are offline, organize into convenient Set Lists, and use BigStand in performance, with or without Internet.

BigStand is based on the previous app GigStand which was in the App Store a while back. Several features have been removed to simplify the user interface for typical users.


To Customize Your BigStand
-----------

If you have some content that you want to "share" amongst your band or choir you have a few choices:

*Get the current version from the App Store, add single tunes and .zip files iTunes file sharing and email
*Take the source code from here and build in your own .zip files in the /samples directory. 

Features that are different
----------------------

The metronome and autoscroller are disabled in this release, but all the code is workable.

> Just add the buttons wherever you'd like them (normally in the bottom center toolbar)
> The long press gesture recognizer should be re-enabled in order to get to the respective control panels for these tools

Triple tap to enter or leave full screen mode regardless of whether the fullscreen button is shown

Playing the blame game
----------------------

If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:

> I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.

Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:

> I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I
> could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in
> the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to
> come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...
>
> I don't want to sound like
> I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you
> just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet
> as I should be in coming up with one.
